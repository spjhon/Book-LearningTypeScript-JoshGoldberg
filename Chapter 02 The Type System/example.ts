let firstName = "Whitney";
firstName.length();
// ~~~~~~
// This expression is not callable.
// Type 'Number' has no call signatures

/*TypeScript came to that complaint by, in order:
1. Reading in the code and understanding there to be a variable named firstName
2. Concluding that firstName is of type string because its initial value is a string,
"Whitney"
3. Seeing that the code is trying to access a .length member of firstName and call
it like a function
4. Complaining that the .length member of a string is a number, not a function (it
canâ€™t be called like a function)
